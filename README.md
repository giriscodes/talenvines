A cute and playful web app to help you ask that special someone to be your Valentine! 🌹

## Features

- 🔒 **Hidden Page**: A secret `/hidden` route where you create personalized proposal links
- 💌 **Personalized Proposals**: Each link contains the partner's name encoded in the URL
- 🎯 **Playful "No" Button**: The "No" button runs away when you try to click it!
